Overview
The Animal Race Simulation is a Java-based application that demonstrates thread concurrency through a race scenario involving two animals, typically portrayed as a hare and a tortoise. The application uses threads to manage the behavior of each animal during the race, such as moving, resting, and eating.

Classes
Animal.java

This class defines the properties and behavior of the animals participating in the race. Each animal is represented as a thread and has attributes like name, position, distance traveled per move, and maximum rest duration. The class includes a run method that details the lifecycle of each animal during the race:

Resting: Each animal rests for a random duration that does not exceed its maximum rest time.
Eating: Animals consume food from a shared resource. The synchronization in the eating process ensures that only one animal can eat at a time.
Moving: After resting and eating, the animal moves forward a certain distance.
AnimalRaceApp.java

This class contains the main method where the race is set up and started. It initializes the animals (hare and tortoise) with specific characteristics (like distance per move and maximum rest time), creates threads for each animal, and starts these threads to begin the race. The shared food resource is also defined here, ensuring that race conditions such as concurrent access are handled.

Food.java

This class manages the shared food resource. The eat method is synchronized, meaning it can only be accessed by one thread at a time, which simulates the animals taking turns to eat. The method includes conditional logic to differentiate the behavior based on which animal is eating, affecting their race strategy. For instance, the hare might eat (sleep) longer, giving the tortoise a chance to advance.

Race Mechanics
The race continues until one of the animals reaches a predefined finish line (this condition appears to be implemented in the logic but not shown in the excerpts).
The use of synchronization and thread management showcases how Java handles concurrent operations and resource sharing among threads.
This simulation serves as an educational tool to understand Java's concurrency capabilities, thread management, and synchronization mechanisms. If you have specific questions about the code or need further details on certain aspects, feel free to ask! â€‹
