Developed a Java-based application to simulate an animal race scenario demonstrating thread concurrency concepts.
Implemented classes including Animal.java, AnimalRaceApp.java, and Food.java to manage the behavior of animals (hare and tortoise) during the race.
Utilized threads to control each animal's actions such as resting, eating, and moving forward, ensuring synchronized access to shared resources.
Defined properties and behavior for each animal, including name, position, distance traveled per move, and maximum rest duration, within the Animal class.
Created the main method in AnimalRaceApp.java to set up and start the race, initializing animals with specific characteristics, creating threads, and handling shared food resources.
Managed the shared food resource using synchronization in the Food class, allowing only one animal to eat at a time and influencing race strategy based on animal behavior.
Demonstrated Java's handling of concurrent operations and resource sharing among threads, emphasizing synchronization and thread management techniques.
